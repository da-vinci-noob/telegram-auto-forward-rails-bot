  #   chosen_inline_result(result_id, query)
  #   callback_query(data)

  # Define public methods ending with `!` to handle commands.
  # Command arguments will be parsed and passed to the method.
  # Be sure to use splat args and default values to not get errors when
  # someone passed more or less arguments in the message.

  #
  #   # full message object is also available via `payload` instance method:
  #   # process_raw_message(payload['text'])
  #
  #   # There are `chat` & `from` shortcut methods.
  #   # For callback queries `chat` is taken from `message` when it's available.
  #   response = from ? "Hello #{from['username']}!" : 'Hi there!'
  #
  #   # There is `respond_with` helper to set `chat_id` from received message:
  #   respond_with :message, text: response
  #
  #   # `reply_with` also sets `reply_to_message_id`:
  #   # reply_with :photo, photo: File.open('party.jpg')
